# DES 228 Project 2

### Spring 2025
### by Scarlett Woolsey


# Project Overview

### "Leonard Cohen" by Boygenius is a song that encapsulates the shared intimacy of everday interactions with one's closest friends. This single chorus piece combines inside jokes between friends, creating space for one another's niche interests, and subtle humor with poetic lyrics to paint a picture of comfort with our people.  The song then finishes with the repeating line “I never thought you’d happen to me”, reflecting on the unpredictable encounters that lead to close relationships down the line.
