   <h2> "Leonard Cohen" </h2>
    Boygenius 
     
    
    On the on-ramp, you said 
    "If you love me, you will listen to this song." 
    And I could tell that you were serious so I 
    Didn't tell you you were driving the wrong way 
    On the interstate until the song was done 
     
    You felt like an idiot, adding an hour to the drive 
    But it gave us more time to embarrass ourselves 
    Telling stories we wouldn't tell anyone else 
    You said, "I might like you less now that you know me so well." 
    I might like you less now that you know me so well 
     
    Leonard Cohen once said, "There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in." 
    And I am not an old man having an existential crisis 
    At a Buddhist monastery writing horny poetry 
    But I agree 
    I never thought you'd happen to me 
    I never thought you'd happen to me
